## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A muted earthy green (#8FBC8F) to evoke a sense of agriculture and nature. It provides a calming and trustworthy feel.
- Background color: A light beige (#F5F5DC), subtly different in hue from the primary. A light color scheme supports readability.
- Accent color: A warm terracotta (#E07A5F), a complementary analogous color to green, is used to draw attention to important CTAs. Slightly desaturated from pure orange/red for a grounded feel.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines to give a geometric and fashionable look, paired with 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text to balance readability with a modern feel.
- Use simple, clear icons related to agriculture and location for easy navigation. Icons should follow a consistent, outlined style.
- Ensure a fully responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) using a grid-based layout.
- Implement subtle transitions and hover effects to enhance user engagement without overwhelming the user interface.
